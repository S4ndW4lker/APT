# ROKRAT

RokRAT is a custom-written backdoor associated with the threat group APT37 and it's name stands for Republic of Korea RAT. RokRAT is a fully-featured backdoor complete with a comprehensive set of features that empower its operators to perform efficient surveillance on the targets, in particular South Korean entities.

In order to deploy the backdoor onto the victim machine, APT37 utilizes spear-phishing emails with attached a zip file, containing PDF, HWP and .LNK files that act as decoy PDF documents, hiding powershell commands executed under the radar.
